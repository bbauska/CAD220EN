In 2020, a survey done by Stack Overflow found Node.js was used by more than 50% of the developers who answered the survey, making it one of the most used frameworks in web development.  
React.js similarly ranked second in the usage category.  
So, as you can tell, both of these frameworks are very popular in server-side and client-side application development.
